Program Details

Input consists of a file of raw loan data (named loandata.txt) in the following format:
        {name} {principal} {term} {annualRate} {creditRating} {fee-optional}

        Example data could be:
        SMITH 20000 5 4.5 750
        JOHNSON 18000 4 4.2 560 2.0


        The principal amount is the loan request in dollars. The term is the duration of the loan in years.
        Note that some loan applicants with a low credit score (under 580) will be required to pay an up-front fee.
        In the example above, it implies that the customer would need to pay 2.0% of the $18,000 requested principal for
        the added risk to the bank for taking on the risky loan.
        For any loan applications without this field, simply list the fee as $0.00.


A typical credit score ranges from 300 to 850. A bank will rate a loan applicant based on this number. From
the raw credit score in the data file, enter the credit rating description (i.e. Fair, Good, etc.) in your output
report.

Credit Score Range Credit Rating
300-579 Very Poor
580-669 Fair
670-739 Good
740-799 Very Good
800-850 Exceptional


Your output should appear as an organized, formal financial report summarizing each order in detail. You
are free to write your output directly to the Java file console or you may choose to write the report to an
external file. This will assist in maintaining the text formatting.


An example format could be:
Customer Principal Rate Years Payment Payoff Fee Credit Rating
xxxxxxxxx $xxxxx.xx x.x% xx $xxxx.xx $xxxxx.xx $xxx.xx xxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxx $xxxxx.xx x.x% xx $xxxx.xx $xxxxx.xx $xxx.xx xxxxxxxxx
â€¦ and so on ...
TOTALS $xxxxx.xx $xxxx.xx $xxxxx.xx $xxx.xx
